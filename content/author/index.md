Pretty much as far back as I can remember, I've always had a deep passion for technical subjects, particularly
mathematics and programming. This has been the driving force behind most of my life, and strongly influenced every
aspect of the path I've been on.

I earned my Bachelor's degree from University of West Bohemia, where I graduated summa cum laude. I originally studied
pure mathematics for two semesters but switched to [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) because the
math was more interesting. In the western world, cybernetics is more commonly known as control theory.

After graduating, I became co-owner of SugarFactory, a [SugarCRM](https://www.sugarcrm.com/) Reseller Partner. With me
serving as its CTO, we built SugarFactory from the ground up and became one of the fastest-growing SugarCRM partners in
Europe, achieving Elite status in just under two years. SugarFactory was eventually acquired by

by [Algotech a.s.](https://en.algotech.cz/).

Taking advantage of my experience in SugarCRM, I went on to build
[Glucose](https://app.archbee.com/public/PREVIEW-HhYtCy8U27R7xpxzxoOy2), a code-generation tool that dramatically
reduces the time it takes to customize SugarCRM, and [QuickQuery](https://www.sugaroutfitters.com/addons/quick-query), a
custom-built, user-friendly query language that transpiles to SQL, complete with parser, compiler and syntax
highlighter.

At about the same time I joined a mid-sized Java-centric organization, where I kickstarted and oversaw a company-wide
migration to Kotlin. It was during this time, and for this purpose, that I wrote the first version of what would become
the [Kotlin Primer](https://www.kotlinprimer.com/).

My recent career has been centered in the JVM world, where I have experience building applications with Spring Boot, and
event-sourced CQRS applications built with [Axon](https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-framework).

Outside of my career, I like to explore less conventional areas---currently, it's Haskell and functional programming in
general, and Common Lisp.

I also speak at meetups:

* [Unexpected properties of exceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NQC4WBKfQk) (2024)
* [Rust, Haskell & Context receivers - a brief introduction to functional error
  handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyMVKe6xICA) (2024)
